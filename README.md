# Final_Year_Project_BEL
This is the final year project for Electrical Engineering. This project is on the topic transient stability of the power system using transient energy function i.e Direct method.  This project covers the development of TEF framework  for deciding the stability of the system and predict the generator rotor angle using LSTM to take control action,
