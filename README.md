# Final_Year_Project_BEL
This is the final year project for Electrical Engineering. This project is on the topic transient stability of the power system using transient energy function i.e Direct method.  This project covers the development of TEF framework  for deciding the stability of the system and predict the generator rotor angle using LSTM to take control action,
 
Work Division

Tasks:

1.TEF Framework –Chandan Sah
 Develop TEF, extract generator states from Simulink, analyze post-fault stability.


2.Data Collection –Binod Sah
 Run all fault simulations, export rotor angles, speeds, voltages, organize data.


3.LSTM Model – Bishal ch
Build/train LSTM to predict post-fault generator states, validate vs TEF results.


4.Documentation – Bhupesh jaisi
 Prepare methodology, results, figures, discussion, references.
