# Final_Year_Project_BEL
This is the final year project for Electrical Engineering. This project is on the topic transient stability of the power system using transient energy function i.e Direct method.  This project covers the development of TEF framework  for deciding the stability of the system and predict the generator rotor angle using LSTM to take control action,
 
Work Division


Bishal work
Bishal You work is to learn how LSTM is used in predicting time series data and
You need to develop LSTM model for our project and intergrate it with the
TEF framework and use the LSTM model to make prediction of rotor angle
for taking control actoion



Binod Work
Binod will be collecting data for training LSTM for our project and
organize the data in proper format for example array, matrix and table
format
His main work involves building LookUp table and data collection by
creating fault at differnt Line in the system. for that You will need to
understand the topology of the IEEE 9 bus system 
You can access the both IEEE9 bus and IEEE 39Bus system from my folder you
can just copy and paste the the models from my folder to your folder. and
run it, make sure to include Ts=0.0167 in workspace. 
The model will only work in Matlab version 2024b and above.


Bhupesh Work
Bhupesh will have access to all the model we are working with and will be
documenting our work for presenting to supervisor. 
He will make sure we are on right track
he will be checking and running the code and model for himself give
necessary suggestion to each of us. 


Chandan Work
Chandan will be developing TEF framework for the project. He will make
sure the TEF framewrok is working properly and is interateable with the
IEEE 9 bus system. The control action will be developed accordingly after
integrating LSTM to the system.
