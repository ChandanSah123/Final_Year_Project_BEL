%His main work involves building LookUp table and data collection by
%creating fault at differnt Line in the system. for that You will need to
%understand the topology of the IEEE 9 bus system 
%You can access the both IEEE9 bus and IEEE 39Bus system from my folder you
%can just copy and paste the the models from my folder to your folder. and
%run it, make sure to include Ts=0.0167 in workspace. 
%The model will only work in Matlab version 2024b and above.
